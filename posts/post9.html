									<h1>Monarchs and Swallowtails</h1>
									<p>Three years ago, my husband Marschall began a new garden and new project.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post9cover.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>After two years
								of being overwhelmed by weeds and insects, he gave up the vegetable garden and instead
								began to focus his energy and time on a butterfly garden in the hopes of attracting butterflies,
								bees and hummingbirds. He began by cultivating the land adjacent to the duck pond area,
								planting a few milkweed, bee’s balm and Joe Pye Weed plants. Each year he cultivates a bit
								more land, adding new plants and new species of plants to the garden. And each year these
								pollinator plants have done their job attracting Monarchs, Swallowtails and a myriad of other
								butterflies, bees and yes, hummingbirds.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post9x01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>But this year we added something different to the mix. At our town’s farmer’s market, we met
								Janie O’Connor, the butterfly lady. She talked to shoppers about butterflies, explaining why
								they are important, and how to raise them. She also sold butterfly cages—cages not to trap
								butterflies, but to give caterpillars a safe place to grow by providing milkweed and a safe haven
								to spin a chrysalis, to develop and nurture within the chrysalis and, at last, emerge as
								Monarchs.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post9x02.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>As of a few weeks ago, we had raised, nurtured and released thirty Monarchs. Each time a
								chrysalis turned from green to black, we held our breath as we watched and waited for the
								butterfly to emerge. Over several hours a butterfly unfurled its wings, then with wings
								expanded, it opened and shut its wings, pumping blood into them to gain strength. When the
								butterfly began moving up and down the sides of the cage, we knew it was time to release it.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post9x03.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Then we walked the cage to our back patio, lifted off the glass pie plate lid (previously put into
								place) and gently caught the butterfly in a pincer finger movement. Next, we placed it near one
								of our nectar filled flowers, so that as its proboscis emerged it would have food to give it m ore
								strength. Our job was now done, and with each release we wished the butterfly well, offering
								up a blessing and a prayer of thanksgiving. The transformation from a tiny speck to a caterpillar
								to a majestic butterfly is miraculous to witness.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post9x04.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Monarchs who lay their eggs during the summer only live about 8 short weeks, while those that
								migrate to Mexico will live over six months. Our first two groups have passed, leaving their
								offspring to make the journey south while our last group of 13 butterflies will be among those
								that head south.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post9x05.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Every time I pass the garden, I stop and watch the butterflies. There are dozens of them and not
								only Monarchs, but also Swallowtails, Viceroys, and White Cabbage butterflies. For now, the
								butterflies are still here, but given the early onset of cool temperatures, the changes in sun and
								light, they will soon be on their way. With a touch of pride tempered by sadness we wish them
								a safe journey.</p>
