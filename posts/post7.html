									<h1>Eventide</h1>
									<p>The evening and its activities are by far the best part of the day for me.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post7cover.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>As I approach the duck pond and outside chicken yard, the roosters and hens emerge from
								under the trees while the ducks swim to the shore and waddle up and out of the water. They
								begin to line up while I check the outdoor nesting boxes for eggs. By the time that I reach the
								barn door, they are lined up ready to go inside.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post7x01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Their evening parade is more subdued than their morning one. Every few steps one of the
								chickens stops and turns as if to go back outside but then thinks better of it and reverses course
								for the roost.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post7x02.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>We have an old mirror in the barn, across from the duck and chicken enclosures. The ducks,
								especially our drake, Cesare, never fail to stop and admire the ducks in the mirror, quacking,</p>
								<p>“Who’s that handsome duck?”</p>
								<p>They know the routine—the ducks in their stall, the chickens on their roost. After one final
								check to make sure they have food and water to last them through the night, I turn off lights
								and secure the door.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post7x03.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>On my way out several barn cats wait for me to fill their food bowls. Even though I feed them
								twice a day, they still run from me if I get too close.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post7x04.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>As I walk back to the house, I hear all my friends clucking and quacking while settling down for
								the night. One last crow from D’Artagnan, then silence...</p>
								<p>Another day’s promise of joy fulfilled.</p>
