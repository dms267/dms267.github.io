									<h1>First Signs of Spring, Part Two</h1>

								<p>A few days ago, there was quite a bit of quacking, crowing and clucking in our barnyard. It was the first sunny day, and even if it wasn’t warm, the snow had receded, and the grass was beginning to turn green.</p>
								<p>It was time to open the doors that had been shut all winter and to let our ducks, roosters, and hens outside.</p>
								<p>Due to our surfeit of roosters (7!) and to say the least their assertive personalities, we have had to split our chickens into four groups. D’Artagne and Athos along with three of our oldest hens, Blanche, Sapphy and Marigold, live with our ducks in the main barn. They share the duck pond area outside and were the first to be let out. As they neared the open door and the fresh air, there was a definite spring to their step. The ducks, not to be left behind, waddled just a bit faster. Alas, even though it was sunny, only one duck, Cesare, was brave enough to test the water.</p>

								<p>Next to be let out was Napoleon, our Buff Orpington rooster. Due to rising tensions and disputes in the main coop area, we separated him and three hens from the main flock and moved them to the old Mallard area, which has its own yard and small pond. Napoleon’s first action upon emerging from the inside coop was to leap on the fence railing and crow. </p>

								<p>Next up were the chickens who live in the main coop—two Copper Maran roosters (Racine and Moliere) and 12 hens. It’s a big flock but they have quite a bit of space. In addition to the indoor coop, nesting and roosting rooms, they have two outside areas in which to roam. When we opened the ramp that leads to the yards, they hesitated, as if to discuss the change in their environment. Then Mirabelle, one of the older hens, impatiently pushed her way through to the ramp and led the way.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post13x06.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The remaining two French roosters, Mazarin and Richelieu, live with hen, Cinnamon, in our duckling and chick nursery. For now, they share the duck pond area with D’Artagne and Athos’s group. Of course, the four roosters do not get along. So, for now, the two groups alternate days on which they go outside. When the ground thaws, we will build an outdoor space with fencing and overhead netting (to protect them from aerial predators such as hawks, owls and eagles) for Mazarin, Richelieu and Cinnamon.</p>
								<p>Please note, that although we fence our birds to protect them from predators, they all have plenty of room to roam and grass to graze!</p>
