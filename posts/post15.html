								<p>“From my living room window as I write I can look out upon the broad front lawns of our farm, like a beautiful picture postcard of wintery New England. In my fireplace the good cedar logs are burning and crackling…” says Barbara Stanwyck’s character in a scene from the 1945 movie Christmas in Connecticut. In the film this excerpt describes an imaginary farm, but for my husband and me, it captures our Christmases or more precisely our winters in Minnesota.</p>
								<p>The last two winters here have been mild with very little snow and warmer temps. But if the temperatures and snowfall of these early winter days are anything to go by, then this winter promises to be a good old fashioned one with subzero temps, high winds, and lots of snow.</p>
								<p>Winter on the farm is beautiful. The fresh snow cover buries autumn’s dead leaves and dirt, making everything look clean and crisp. Snow on the roofs of the barn and outbuildings lends a nostalgic air of Christmases and winters past. Sunny days follow snowy days and nights, casting a sparkle to everything.</p>

								<p>Winter on the farm is harsh. The temperature this morning registered minus 10; tonight, it will be a balmy minus 1, and by Saturday night it will be minus 20. Beneath the snow lie icy patches of which we need to take heed. Falling on the ice could be deadly. And the sun, while brilliant, fails to heat the earth.</p>
								<div class="image main" style="width: 100%;"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post15x02.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Our outside work and worries change with the seasons. Birds and deer and other unseen animals rely on us for food and water. This morning twenty-some blue jays perched in the trees near the courtyard, waiting for peanuts. No matter how cold it is, we need to be diligent in keeping the feeders full.</p>
								<p>Most of our barn cats have moved inside the barn which we keep heated. But there are always a few that remain outside—for these we’ve built houses to shelter them and have heated food and water bowls. Yet, I worry about them.</p>
								<p>Our ducks and chickens have moved inside, where they will remain for the next three months.  Even with the barn and coop heated, chickens are prone to frostbite on their combs. Part of the winter’s chores is monitoring the inside temperatures and making sure the heaters are working and the water dispensers don’t freeze.</p>

								<p>Our dogs love to play in the snow. They run and tumble and wrestle like puppies. But they have aged (now 6, 9, and 11), and such low temperatures have become almost intolerable, and they are quick about their business.</p>
								<p>Yet, life on the farm, especially caring for the animals, remains deeply rewarding.</p>
