									<h1>The Gunflint Trail</h1>
									<p>By Ben the Dog Smith</p>
								</header>

								<p>I see the suitcases. I watch as they pack, grabbing and arranging clothes. I begin to
								pace. I know they are leaving. I don’t want them to go.</p>
								<p>She sings the “Crate Dog” song. We know the song. We know what it means. We run
								into the bedroom. We take our positions. Coco on the floor on the dog bed next to
								our bed. Oliver in his crate. Me on the bed. Charlotte following the cookie in her
								hand.</p>
								<p>But this time, after she has handed out the cookies, she calls for me: “Come, Ben,
								come!” I come, but I don’t understand.</p>
								<p>I worry. They are leaving, that much I know. There are suitcases and bags being
								loaded into our car. She attaches a leash and leads me to the car. She opens the back
								door and motions that I should jump inside.</p>

								<p>The kennel? The vet? Places I fear. Places I love. Why? I wonder. Why am I going?
								Where am I going? Why do the others get to stay at home?</p>
								<p>We start driving. In soft voices they tell me I am a good boy. They pet me. We drive.
								We stop at places where I don’t know the scents. He walks me. I am distracted by the
								smells, the sounds, the space. I am distracted by my fear.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post10x03.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>We drive on and on and on.</p>
								<p>We stop. He walks me while she enters a place I’ve never been before. More new
								scents, new sounds, and new spaces. Fearful now and yet…They are calm. They are
								happy.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post10x04.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I am confused. I try not to be, but I am scared. Are they giving me away? Will I ever
								get back home? Memories of my life before they brought me home come to me.
								Always hungry. Always wrong. Always scared.</p>
								<p>Back into the car, we drive, but only a short distance. A new place with a kitchen, a
								sofa and a chair, a bedroom and bathroom. I stay with her, close to her, as she
								unpacks bags. I stay with her while he brings the luggage and bags from the car.</p>
								<p>They sit and talk. She hugs me, and I crawl onto her lap. He pets me. I begin to relax.</p>
								<div class="image main" style="transform: rotate(180deg);"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post10x05.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post10x06.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>We walk. I meet a dog, who barks at me. I meet some ducks, who run from me. I
								meet new people, who make friends with me.</p>
								<p>I sleep on the bed next to her. She places her hand on my head. She is there, and he
								is next to her. I am safe.</p>
								<p>In the morning, he leaves. I lie on the sofa next to her. She reads. She types. She
								places her hand on my head and kisses me. I doze.</p>
								<p>He returns, we eat lunch. They put on coats and boots. I sit waiting for my turn,
								waiting for my leash.</p>
								<p>We walk. A long walk in another new space. Lots of smells. The ground is muddy.
								Other animals have come this way. Horses, I think. Nose to the ground, I sniff other,
								wild smells. We walk up hill. I’m excited.</p>
								<div class="image main" style="transform: rotate(180deg);"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post10x07.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="image main" style="transform: rotate(90deg); margin: 7em 0 7em 0;"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post10x08.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>“Heel,” she says. I slow down, but new scents beckon me. We hear other people. We
								hear clomping. He takes me off the road to make way for what is coming. She stands
								near the trees.</p>
								<p>People on horses approach. “Please, don’t hide. You are scaring the horses—it’s
								better if they see you. They need to know you won’t eat them,” says the woman on
								the lead horse.</p>
								<p>We step out of the woods, onto the edge of the path. It takes all my will power not to
								bark. I hold back the bark, but a whimper or two escape.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post10x09.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post10x10.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>After dinner, we walk along the lake. The water moves. The water slaps the rocks. I
								dip my paw in and pull it back. Cold. Wet. Noisy. Water.</p>
								<p>The next day it rains. We get in the car. Are we going home? I wonder. But no, we
								drive to a town. There are people. There are dogs. I try not to bark. Instead, I
								whimper my greetings.</p>
								<p>We drive some more. “I want to look,” she says. She stops the car. We get out and
								walk.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post10x11.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This morning, they bring out the luggage. They pack. She empties the fridge and
								cabinets. He takes bags to the car. They are quiet. They are sad. I am scared. I stand
								by the door. I want to get into the car. I am afraid they will forget me. Afraid that
								now they will leave me.</p>
								<p>But they don’t forget me. They don’t leave me.</p>
								<p>I hop onto the back seat. I look out the window. I sniff the air. Familiar now. She
								drives. They talk. We are going home.</p>
								<p>I drift off to sleep.</p>
