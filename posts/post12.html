									<h1>First Signs of Spring</h1>
									<p>As we shelter in place</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post12cover.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I just happened to glance out one of our bedroom windows and there, in the muddy remnants of last year’s lawn, on a gray, wet March afternoon, stood a Robin, the first sign of Spring. Just beyond the Robin, a bank of snow lingers, reminding us here in Minnesota that although we are heading into longer and warmer days, one last snowfall may come.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post12x01.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Other species of birds have also returned: Red-winged Blackbirds, Starlings, and the Canada Goose. I spot one of my favorites—the Boat-tailed Grackle. It flutters from branch to branch in the white pine near the backyard feeders, its cranky call announcing its presence. It is most likely a scout presaging the arrival of a flock of Grackles, who will fill our trees, if only momentarily.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post12x02.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>At night, our open windows reveal the return of at least two other species: Owls and Sandhill Cranes. Although darkness prevents us from catching sight of them, their distinctive calls make us aware of their presence. A cacophony of hooting reveals that at least three different kinds of Owls have taken up residence in our yard while clanking noises signal the reappearance of the Cranes.</p>
								<p>All the birds, not just the ones making their way North, are busy. Their chirping and trilling fill the yards as they feed, nest, and prepare for this year’s chicks. An eagle swoops in and lands on the cottonwood. Two ravens circle and lunge towards it. Perhaps the eagle has gotten too close to the ravens’ nest. For now, the eagle, escorted by the two ravens, retreats.</p>
								<p>These birds are heralds not only of Spring, but also the promise of hope that the new season brings with it.</p>
								<p>As we shelter in place, the birds remind us that life goes on, that during the strangeness of these days there is continuity.</p>
