									<h1>End of Summer</h1>
									<p>Yesterday I saw a boy wearing a hoodie. I said to myself, it’s official, summer is ending.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post8cover.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>It’s not the first football game (which was yesterday Colgate vs Villanova) which marks the beginning of the
								end of summer or school books or pumpkin spice coffee ads at Dunkin Donuts but that boy in his hoodie. The
								hoodie will get heavier and heavier until it becomes a down jacket with a hood in December or even
								November.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post8x01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>On the farm I watch my husband dig and mulch to protect the flower beds he has spent so much time on in
								spring and summer. I hear the calls of the sandhill cranes as they prepare to fly away and watch as they soar
								overhead. The monarch butterflies we bred for weeks and weeks still flutter between milkweed blossoms,
								but I know they too will be leaving us soon for the long journey to Mexico. I will miss them and the other
								butterflies and even the bees.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="../images/blog_images/fulls/post8x02.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The corn is high now. But the days are cool and the nights even colder. Yes, it’s Minnesota, but even for
								Minnesota it is colder than the end of August should be. Will the frost wait a few weeks for those anxious
								farmers to harvest the corn? But I fear that this run of sixty- and seventy-degree days and fifty-degree nights
								are too cold.</p>
								<p>This world, this life, this farm move in continual transitions as each thing blossoms then fades and moves on.
								So, we pick the apples from the tree in front of the barn and smile and remember the summer that gave
								them to us.</p>
								<p>As I walk the dogs, I marvel at how quickly the days begin to shorten. Dawn comes later and dusk earlier. The
								sun sits low on the horizon—it is a fall sun, a September sun. The leaves on our boxelder and silver
								maple—are beginning to turn color as summer’s green mantle transitions to gold and yellow.</p>
								<p>Fall is my favorite time of year. The last of the summer harvest yields up pumpkins, squash, and gourds. Soon
								setting a fire in the fireplace will replace suppers on the patio. And dusting off wool jackets, sweaters,
								mittens and scarves becomes akin to greeting old friends.</p>
								<p>“I suppose in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go, but what always hurts the
								most is not taking a moment to say goodbye” <br /> 
								- from Life of Pi</p>
