								<p>We have a new tenant at Ravensfield Farm. She (we are assuming it is a she, but it could be a
								he) arrived late Sunday afternoon. My husband and I were in my study attending a a virtual
								book group. My husband, whose mind tends to stray, tapped me on the shoulder and pointed
								out the window. “Look who is here!” he said.</p>
								<p>A raccoon was waddling across our back patio, looking for birdseed no doubt. After
								investigating the different bins of bird food, she seemingly moved on her way. This was a good
								thing as our dogs spend quite a bit of time on our back patio looking for stray seeds and nuts to
								eat. I didn’t think they would be too happy about sharing the patio and the forbidden rations
								with a raccoon. I also didn’t want them to tussle with a raccoon—I was worried for the racoon
								and for our dogs.</p>
								<p>Later that night as I was shutting down the lights and heading off to bed, I noticed that two of our cats were lying on the rug near the front door. Actually, they weren’t lying so much as
								positioning themselves in the “there is a mouse here” stance. Cat owners will know this stance.
								Cats do it when they see or hear a mouse. Or think they do. Only it usually takes place in front
								of the stove or refrigerator not inside the entrance hall.</p>
								<p>Curious as to what they were “hunting” I looked out the window and saw a big puff ball of fur,
								curled up by the outside cat food bowl. (Ok, I know—this may be confusing, but remember we
								have inside semi-tamed house cats and outdoor, completely feral barn cats. The food bowl on
								the front stoop was for the latter.) So, the cats were hunting the raccoon. (Don’t worry! The
								cats are indoor cats and truth be told they are terrible hunters—they are easily distracted and
								mostly lazy).</p>
								<p>The next morning, the raccoon was still there, sound asleep. We were worried that maybe she
								was sick or old or injured. As the day went on, however, she began to move explore her new
								home and eat. We put water out for her. My husband looked up raccoons to find out what they
								like to eat—eggs were at the top of the list, which is good, because we have plenty of eggs from
								our hens. We put out eggs, corn, cat food, and peanuts. As she moved about, we could tell that
								she was young—probably a juvenile and that she wasn’t sick or injured, maybe just cold and
								hungry. (It has been a hard winter in Minnesota—so many subzero days!) Yesterday she
								climbed one of the trellises against our house and slept up high. While she slept, my husband
								folded an old beach towel into a bed and placed it in a sheltered part of the stoop.</p>
								<p>Since she took up residence near Valentine’s Day, we named her Valentine. For now, she lives
								on our front stoop and in our courtyard.</p>
